# Python_Project

Hi, Welcome to my python project for Comparative programming languages. 
My project is a basic game of pong that I have made to be much more fun by adding a money system and powerups along with fun decorations.
The project should be able to run with pretty much any software that is able to run python3 programs (such as spyder) along with the pygame library
